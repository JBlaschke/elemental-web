* How to: generate web pages

    make html

  This will read .rst files from the 'source' directory
  and generate .html files in the 'build/html' directory.

* How to: publish web pages

    ./publish.sh

  This will upload the generated pages from 'build/html'
  to fenicsproject.org/new. Running this script requires
