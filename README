FEniCS documentation and webpage
--------------------------------

* How to: generate web pages

    make html

  This will read .rst files from the 'source' directory
  and generate .html files in the 'build/html' directory.

* How to: import documentation

    scripts/import_docs

  This will import documentation input files (.rst) from all
  projects, build .html files and add those to 'build/html'.
  Running this script requires that all projects (currently
  DOLFIN and UFL) have been built and that the environment
  variables DOLFIN_DIR and UFL_DIR have been set.

* How to: publish web pages

    ./publish.sh

  This will upload the generated pages from 'build/html' to
  fenicsproject.org/new, including both the web pages and the
  documentation pages. Running this script requires access to
  the account fenics@fenicsproject.org.

FIXME: Consider changing the name/location of some of the above
scripts, possibly adding as targets to make.
