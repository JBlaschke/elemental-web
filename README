FEniCS documentation
--------------------

To build all documentation, simply type

  make all

Note that you need to have the ufc module in your PYTHONPATH variable in order
to generate the Python programmer's reference.

In the future when we add documentation for FFC, UFC, UFL, viper etc. you will
also need to have these modules in your path.

To update the C++ programmer's reference and the demos from a specific DOLFIN
installation you need to set the DOLFIN_DIR variable and run the two scripts
utils/generate_cpp_doc.py and utils/copy_demos.sh before building the
documentation.
