..  Demos documentation master file, created by
    sphinx-quickstart on Mon Apr 19 13:37:52 2010.
    You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
    contain the root `toctree` directive.
    This is where we put the documentation for all demos from DOLFIN.

    NOTE: KBO: We need to figure out how to share common text between the 
    C++/Python versions.

Welcome to FEniCS Demos's documentation!
########################################

This part of the FEniCS documentation is concerned with all the demos found
in the `DOLFIN <https://launchpad.net/dolfin>`_ source directory.
The documentation is provided in two different flavours, C++ and Python, that
solve the same problem, but uses slightly different syntax.

Contents:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    cpp/cpp_demos_index
    python/python_demos_index
