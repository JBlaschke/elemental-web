Introduction

The FEniCS Project is a collection of free software aimed at
automated, efficient solution of differential equations. The project
provides tools for working with computational meshes, finite element
variational formulations of PDEs, ODE solvers and linear algebra.

*The FEniCS web pages were vandalised recently, so we're in the process
of building a new site.*
