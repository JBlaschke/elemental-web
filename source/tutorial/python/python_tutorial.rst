..  This is where we put the Python version of the FEniCS tutorial from
    Hans Petter Langtangen.

.. python_tutorial:

**************
Python version
**************

From the Launchpad `blueprint
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fenics-doc/+spec/tutorial>`_:

* The FEniCS tutorial should come in two flavors, C++ and Python.

* It should be available as both HTML and PDF.

* It should link directly to downloadable and runnable code identical to what
  is presented in the tutorial.

* It should be based on Hans Petter Langtangen's tutorial for the FEniCS book.
  Discussion needed on which format to use (reST?) and how it should be
  coordinated with any future versions of the book chapter.

Link to C++ version?
