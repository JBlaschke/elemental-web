..  This is where we put the Python version of the FEniCS User Manual.

**************
Python version
**************

From the Launchpad `blueprint
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fenics-doc/+spec/user-manual>`_:

* The FEniCS User Manual should be hand-written in reST and converted to HTML
  and PDF using Sphinx.

* Relevant parts should also be available as docstrings in the Python
  interface. This should be possible to fix with some clever scripting
  (assigning to __doc__).

* It should come in two different flavors, C++ and Python. As much as possible,
  material should be reused between the two.

* It should replace the current user manuals for DOLFIN, FFC, UFL and UFC.

* Emphasis should be on documenting the DOLFIN user interface. Details for FFC,
  UFL and UFC should be placed in Appendix.

* It should include numerous small examples (code snippets) that illustrate
  each function.

* It should contain a HOWTO chapter that answers questions like how do I set
  Neumann boundary conditions, how do I compute norms, how do I compute errors
  etc.
