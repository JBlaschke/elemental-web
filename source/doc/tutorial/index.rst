FEniCS tutorial (Python)

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen

This document presents a FEniCS tutorial to get new users quickly up
and going with solving differential equations. FEniCS can be
programmed both in C++ and Python, but this tutorial focuses
exclusively on Python programming, since this is the simplest approach
to exploring FEniCS for beginners and since it actually gives
high performance. After having digested the examples in this tutorial,
the reader should be able to learn more from the FEniCS
documentation and from the demos and the FEniCS book *Automated
Scientific Computing*, edited by Logg, Mardal, and Wells.
