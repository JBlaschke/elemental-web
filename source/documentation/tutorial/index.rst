FEniCS tutorial (Python)
########################

*Written by Hans Petter Langtangen*

This document presents a FEniCS tutorial to get new users quickly up
and going with solving differential equations. FEniCS can be
programmed both in C++ and Python, but this tutorial focuses
exclusively on Python programming, since this is the simplest approach
to exploring FEniCS for beginners and since it actually gives high
performance. After having digested the examples in this tutorial, the
reader should be able to learn more from the FEniCS documentation and
from the demos and the FEniCS book *Automated Solution of Differential
Equations by the Finite Element Method: The FEniCS Book*, edited by
Logg, Mardal, and Wells.

The tutorial is still in an initial state so the reader is encouraged
to send email to the author on ``hpl@simula.no`` about typos, errors,
and suggestions for improvements.

`A LaTeX/PDF version <fenics_tutorial_1.0.pdf>`_ is also available, in
addition to a `tarball with all programs referred to
fenics_tutorial_examples.tar.gz>`_ in this tutorial (pack out with the
Unix command ``tar xvzf fenics_tutorial_examples.tar.gz``).
