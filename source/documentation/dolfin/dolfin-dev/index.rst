Software documentation for DOLFIN development branch
----------------------------------------------------

This is documentation for the development version of DOLFIN (updated
at random intervals). This documentation comprises three main parts:

* The :ref:`tutorial` which focuses on getting users
  started solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in FEniCS. The
  tutorial is self-contained and shows how to use FEniCS tools to
  setup and solve problems. This is the ideal place to start for
  newcomers to FEniCS and people who are simply curious to learn what
  FEniCS is all about.

  .. The FEniCS Python tutorial is also available PDF format
  .. :download:`FEniCS tutorial
  .. (Python)<../../../_static/fenics-tutorial-python.pdf>`.

* The **demos** which is a collection of *ready to run code
  examples* that demonstrate many of the features of FEniCS. The demos
  can also serve as code templates for users who wish to implement
  their own solvers in FEniCS.

* The
  :ref:`documentation_dolfin_dolfin_dev_programmers_reference_cpp_index`
  which contains detailed documentation of the FEniCS user interface.

The tutorial is available in Python. The demos are available in both
C++ and Python. The Programmer's Reference is available in C++.
