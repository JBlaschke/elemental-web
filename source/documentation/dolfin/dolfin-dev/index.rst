Software documentation for DOLFIN development branch
----------------------------------------------------

This is documentation for the development version of DOLFIN (updated
at random intervals). This documentation comprises three main parts:

* The :ref:`tutorial` which focuses on getting users started solving
  partial differential equations (PDEs) in FEniCS. The tutorial is
  self-contained and shows how to use FEniCS tools to setup and solve
  problems. This is the ideal place to start for newcomers to FEniCS
  and people who are simply curious to learn what FEniCS is all about.

  .. The FEniCS Python tutorial is also available PDF format
  .. :download:`FEniCS tutorial
  .. (Python)<../../../_static/fenics-tutorial-python.pdf>`.

* The **demos** which is a collection of *ready to run code
  examples* that demonstrate many of the features of FEniCS. The demos
  can also serve as code templates for users who wish to implement
  their own solvers in FEniCS.

* The
  :ref:`documentation_dolfin_dolfin_dev_programmers_reference_cpp_index`
  and
  :ref:`documentation_dolfin_dolfin_dev_programmers_reference_python_index`
  contain detailed documentation of the FEniCS user interface for C++
  and Python, respectively.
