Welcome to the documentation for the `FEniCS Project
<http://www.fenicsproject.org/>`_. The FEniCS documentation comprises
three main parts:

* The **tutorial** which focuses on getting users started
  solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in FEniCS. The
  tutorial is self-contained and shows how to use FEniCS tools to
  setup and solve problems. This is the ideal place to start for
  newcomers to FEniCS and people who are simply curious to learn what
  FEniCS is all about.

* The **demos** which is a collection of *ready to run code
  examples* that demonstrate many of the features of FEniCS. The demos
  can also serve as code templates for users who wish to implement
  their own solvers in FEniCS.

* The **programmers reference** which contains detailed documentation
  of the FEniCS user interface.

Each part is available in both a C++ and a Python version.

Suggestions on how to improve the FEniCS software and the
documentation are very welcome. Please see :ref:`contributing` for how
to proceed.
