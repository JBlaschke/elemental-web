The FEniCS Book
###############

Together with `Springer <http://www.springer.com>`__, we are preparing
a book to document the methodology and software developed as part of
the FEniCS Project. The title of the book is `Automated Solution of
Differential Equations by the Finite Element Method
<http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>`__. The
book will appear as volume 84 of the Springer `Lecture Notes in
Computational Science and Engineering
<http://www.springer.com/series/3527>`__.

The book manuscript has been submitted to the publisher and is
currently in production. We expect the book to be available in the
fall of 2011. A preliminary version of the book can be found `here
<http://www.fenicsproject.org/pub/book/book>`__.
