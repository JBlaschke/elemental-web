The FEniCS Book
###############

Together with `Springer <http://www.springer.com>`__, we are preparing
a book to document the methodology and software developed as part of
the FEniCS Project. The working title of the book is *Automated
Solution of Differential Equations by the Finite Element Method*.

We are currently in the `final stages
<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~fenics-editors/fenics-book/main/view/head:/STATUS>`__
of editing and proofreading, and we expect the book to be available in
the fall of 2011. A preliminary version of the book can be found `here
<http://www.fenicsproject.org/pub/book/book>`__.
