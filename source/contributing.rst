Contributing
############

There are several ways to contribute to the FEniCS project.
The easiest way is to simply use the software and give feedback about the
experience on the appropriate mailing list.
However, since there are still plenty of things left to be done, we encourage
users to take more active part in developing software and writing
documentation.
Of course as an active developer it is also easier to influence the direction
an focus of the individual projects.
FEniCS uses `Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/>`_ for managing and hosting the
projects and `FEniCS development <http://www.fenics.org/wiki/Development>`_
contain more information about the organisation of projects on Launchpad.

*****************************
Helping out through Launchpad
*****************************

The core components of FEniCS all uses Launchpad for answers to questions from
users, specification tracking via blueprints, bug tracking and code hosting.

Answers
=======

New users of software of a given project often have questions regarding usage
and best practises.
They will (or at least they should) ask questions using the
`Launchpad Answers <https://help.launchpad.net/Answers>`_ functionality.
Of course the developers of the given project are in the best position to
answer these questions, but very often the number of developers is less than a
handful and since the developers are often active in more than one group or
project any help from you is greatly appreciated.
`DOLFIN questions <https://answers.launchpad.net/dolfin>` show the questions
and answers so far related to the DOLFIN project.

Blueprints
==========

As a user you might sometimes be missing features in the projects which could
make your own code more efficient or simplify the way you do things in the
code.
The missing feature could even prevent you from solving the problem that you
want, or maybe you have found a better way of implementing a current feature.
FEniCS uses `Blueprints <https://help.launchpad.net/Blueprint>`_ to keep track
of the specifications for new features planned in the projects.
However, before adding a new blueprint it is a good idea to first discuss the
design on the relevant mailing list.
`DOLFIN blueprints <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/dolfin>` show the current
blueprints for the DOLFIN project.

Bugs
====

FEniCS software is under active development.
As a consequence bugs are likely to occur from time to time.
In the event that you encounter a bug, please file a bug report using the
Launchpad system for tracking `Bugs <https://help.launchpad.net/Bugs>`.
`DOLFIN bugs <https://bugs.launchpad.net/dolfin>` show a list of currently
known bugs in the DOLFIN project.

Contributing code
=================

Intro,
Coding style for projects. C++ and Python PEP-8
Write access just push minor changes. Implementing blueprints, fixing bugs.
otherwise two ways to commit code, minor changes in patches, bigger changes
blueprints new features branch and merge.

Writing documentation
*********************

The :ref:`guidelines` page explains what the documentation should look like.

Documenting demos
=================

See :ref:`demos_missing_demos`.

* Add code files for download.
* Code snippets in text
* Review

Programmer's reference
======================

Figure out how this should be organised and what requirements we have.
