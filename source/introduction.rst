Introduction

This is the documentation for the
`FEniCS Project <http://fenics.org/wiki/FEniCS_Project>`_.

Although the FEniCS Project consists of many `software components
<http://fenics.org/wiki/Projects>`_, the main focus of this
documentation is on the FEniCS user interface.

The documentation comprises three main parts:

* :ref:`tutorial_index`, which focuses on getting users started
  solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in FEniCS. The
  tutorial is self-contained and shows how to use FEniCS tools to
  setup and solve problems. This is the ideal place to start for
  newcomers to FEniCS and people who are simply curious to learn what
  exactly FEniCS is all about.

* :ref:`demos_index`, which is a collection of *ready to run code
  examples* which demonstrate many of the features of FEniCS. The
  demos can also serve as code templates for users that wish to
  implement their own solvers in FEniCS.

* :ref:`programmers_reference_index`, which contains detailed
  documentation of the FEniCS user interface.

All three parts of the documentation are available in both C++ and a
Python versions and they can be accessed online as HTML or downloaded
as PDF files.

Suggestions for improving FEniCS software and documentation is
welcome. Please see :ref:`contributing` for how to do this.
