Introduction
============

Do some copy paste stuff from the FFC Manual, maybe there's a clever tool to
convert the LaTeX source to rst?
Have a look at all the chapters in the manual, many seems to be outdated
e.g., the formlanguage chapter which is now handled by UFL.

Since this is a programmer's reference we should rely on the autodoc features
of Sphinx like we do for the dolfin modules and just add supplementary text.
