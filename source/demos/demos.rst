..  This is where we put the documentation for all demos from DOLFIN.

    NOTE: KBO: We need to figure out how to share common text between the 
    C++/Python versions.

FEniCS Demos
############

This part of the FEniCS documentation is concerned with all the demos found
in the `DOLFIN <https://launchpad.net/dolfin>`_ source directory.
The documentation is provided in two different flavours, C++ and Python, that
solve the same problem, but uses slightly different syntax.

Contents:

The demos are also available in PDF format, see

:download:`Python version<../../build/latex/python_demos.pdf>`.
