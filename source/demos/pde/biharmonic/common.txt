Equation and problem definition
-------------------------------

The biharmonic equation is a fourth-order elliptic equation. On the domain
:math:`\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}`, :math:`1 \le d \le 3`, it reads

.. math::
   \nabla^{4} u = f \quad {\rm in} \ \Omega

where :math:`\nabla^{4} \equiv \nabla^{2} \nabla^{2}` is the biharmonic
operator and :math:`f` is a prescribed source term. To formulate a complete
boundary value problem, the biharmonic equation must be complemented by
suitable boundary conditions.

Multiplying the biharmonic equation by a test function and integrating
by parts twice leads to a problem second-order derivatives, which would
requires :math:`H^{2}` conforming (roughly :math:`C^{0}` continuous) basis
functions.  To solve the biharmonic equation using Lagrange finite element
basis functions, the biharmonic equation can be split into two second-order
equations (see :ref:`demos_python_pde_mixed-poisson` for a mixed method for
the Poisson equation), or a variational formulation can be constructed that
imposes weak continuity of normal derivatives between finite element cells.
The demo uses a discontinuous Galerkin approach to impose continuity of the
normal derivative weakly.

A weak formulation of the biharmonic which can be solved used standard
continuous Lagrange finite element functions reads: find :math:`u \in V`
such that

.. math::
   \sum_{K} \int_{K} \nabla^{2} v \nabla^{2} u \, dx \
  - \int_{\Tilde{\Gamma}} \left<\nabla^{2} v \right> \left[\nabla u \cdot n \right] \, ds
  - \int_{\Tilde{\Gamma}} \left[\nabla v \cdot n \right] \left<\nabla^{2} u \right>  \, ds
  + \int_{\Tilde{\Gamma}} \frac{\alpha}{h} \left[ \nabla v \right] \left[ \nabla u \right] \, ds
  = \int_{\Omega} vf \, dx \quad \forall \ v \in V

where . . . . . and :math:`\alpha \ge 0` is a penalty term.
