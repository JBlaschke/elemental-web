This example demonstrates the solution of a particular nonlinear time-dependent
fourth-order equation, known as the Cahn-Hilliard equation. In particular it
demonstrates the use of

* A mixed finite element method
* Automatic linearisation
* The Newton solver
* The :math:`\theta`-method for time-dependent equations


The Cahn-Hilliard equation is a parabolic equation
and is typically used to model phase separation in binary mixtures.
The equation reads:

.. math::
   \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot M(\nabla(\mu + \lambda \nabla^{2}c)) &= f \quad {\rm in} \ \Omega \\
                M \lambda \nabla c \cdot \boldsymbol{n} &= 0 \quad {\rm on} \ \partial\Omega \\
                M(\nabla(\mu + \lambda \nabla^{2}c)) &= 0 \quad {\rm on} \ \partial\Omega

Since this is a fourth-order equation, casting it in a weak form would result in the
presence of second-order spatial derivatives, and this coould not be solved using
standard Lagrange finite element basis functions. A solution is to rephrase the equation
as two coupled second-order equations:

.. math::
   \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot M \nabla\mu  &= 0 \quad {\rm in} \ \Omega \\
   \mu -  \mu_{c} - \lambda \nabla^{2}c &= 0 \quad {\rm in} \ \Omega \\
