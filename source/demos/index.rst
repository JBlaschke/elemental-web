FEniCS Demos
############

A simple way to learn how to use FEniCS is to study the collection of
demos available as part of this documentation. These example programs
demonstrate different features of FEniCS with a particular focus on
how to build simple solvers for PDEs.

All demos are available in both C++ and Python versions and are ideal
as starting points for new projects. Find the demo that best fits your
application and modify it to suit your needs. Please see the
instructions on :ref:`how to run the C++ demos
<demos_cpp_running_demos>` and :ref:`how to run the Python demos
<demos_python_running_demos>`.

   The demos found here are identical to the demos distributed as part
   of the DOLFIN source code.

.. FIXME: Do we plan to have PDF versions of demos?
.. The demos are also available in PDF format, see
.. :download:`C++ versions <../../build/latex/cpp_demos.pdf>` or
.. :download:`Python versions <../../build/latex/python_demos.pdf>`.
