.. This is where we put the documentation for all demos from DOLFIN.

    NOTE: KBO: We need to figure out how to share common text between the 
    C++/Python versions.

FEniCS Demos
############

This part of the FEniCS documentation is concerned with all the demos found
in the `DOLFIN <https://launchpad.net/dolfin>`_ source directory.
The documentation is provided in two different flavours, C++ and Python, that
solve the same problem, but uses slightly different syntax.

Each demo contains source files ready for download. Please see the instructions
on :ref:`how to run the C++ demos <demos_cpp_running_demos>` and
:ref:`how to run the Python demos <demos_python_running_demos>`.

From the Launchpad `blueprint
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fenics-doc/+spec/demos>`_.

* The demos should be identical to the demos available as part of DOLFIN.

* But they should be made easily accessible in HTML (and easily downloadable).

* The purpose of each demo should be stated clearly
  (which feature of DOLFIN it demonstrates).

* Perhaps the demos need to be recategorized.

The demos are also available in PDF format, see

:download:`Python version<../../build/latex/python_demos.pdf>`.
