From the Launchpad `blueprint
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fenics-doc/+spec/demos>`_.

* The demos should be identical to the demos available as part of DOLFIN.

* But they should be made easily accessible in HTML (and easily downloadable).

* The purpose of each demo should be stated clearly
  (which feature of DOLFIN it demonstrates).

* Perhaps the demos need to be recategorized.
