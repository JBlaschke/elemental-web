Supported compilers
###################

C++11 support is required as of Elemental 0.82, and so reasonably up-to-date
compilers are now necessary. More detailed information will hopefully follow
soon, but the following compilers have been verified to compile the recent
releases of Elemental:

* GCC >= 4.7.1
* Clang >= 3.4
* Intel >= 14.0.1 (support is very recent)

Releases 0.81 and before support the majority of common compilers, with the
known exception of the Sun Studio Compilers.
