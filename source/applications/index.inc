          <img alt='' src='/_static/images/ascot.png'
          class='avatar avatar-84 photo' height='84' width='84' />

	  <p> ASCoT is a light-weight, FEniCS-based, Python module
          designed for examining and determining the numerical
          stability of finite element discretizations. Its
          functionality allows for identifying stable mixed finite
          element spaces for variational saddle point problems, for
          optimizing stabilization constants, and in general, for
          computing stability constants through series of eigenvalue
          problems.  </p>

	  <p>FEniCS Plasticity is a library that implements the Von Mises and
          Drucker-Prager plasticity models using FEniCS software.
          However, the structure of the library should be general enough to also
          allow other models to be implemented with little effort.
