******************************
Taking part in the development
******************************

Each component of FEniCS is registered as a project on Launchpad and
each project is connected to a pair of teams. The first team consists
of developers and users interested in the development of the
project. This team is open to everyone and has a mailing list where
the development of the project is discussed. The second team (the core
team) manages the project and has write-access to the source code.

The first thing a prospective developer needs to do is to register an
account on Launchpad and add herself/himself to the relevant project
teams. Membership to core teams is only granted after a developer has
proven reliable by committing a significant number of high quality
contributions.

Mailing lists
=============

The development of FEniCS is discussed actively on the Launchpad
mailing list for each component and on the `FEniCS mailing list
<https://lists.launchpad.net/fenics/>`__ itself. To subscribe to a
mailing list, you first need to join the relevant team. Links to
Launchpad mailing list and team pages can be found at the
:ref:`Launchpad links page <launchpad_pages>`.

User questions
==============

User questions are discussed on the :ref:`help_answers` pages.
Developers should make sure to join the relevant team for each component so
that they will be notified about new user questions.

Bug reports
===========

Bug reports are discussed on the :ref:`help_bugs` pages.
Developers should make sure to join the relevant team for each component so
that they will be notified about new bugs.

.. _contributing_blueprints:

Blueprints
==========

FEniCS uses `blueprints <https://help.launchpad.net/Blueprint>`_ to
keep track of the specifications for new features. Before adding a new
blueprint it is a good idea to first discuss the design on the
relevant mailing list.

`FEniCS blueprints <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fenics>`_ is the
place for general FEniCS blueprints and `DOLFIN blueprints
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/dolfin>`_ is the place for
blueprints regarding the FEniCS user interface DOLFIN. Links to
Launchpad blueprint pages for all FEniCS projects can be found
:ref:`Launchpad links page <launchpad_pages>`.
