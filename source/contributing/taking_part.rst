******************************
Taking part in the development
******************************

Each component of FEniCS is hosted on Bitbuket.  The first thing a
prospective developer needs to do is to register an account on
Bitbucket.


Mailing lists
=============

The development of FEniCS is discussed actively on the
mailing list `FEniCS mailing list
<http://fenicsproject.org/mailman/listinfo/fenics/>`__.

User questions
==============

User questions are discussed on the :ref:`help_answers` pages.
Developers should make sure to join the relevant team for each component so
that they will be notified about new user questions.

Bug reports
===========

Bug reports are discussed on the :ref:`help_bugs` pages.

.. _contributing_blueprints:

Blueprints
==========

FEniCS uses 'Bitbucket issues' to keep track of the specifications for
new features. Before adding a new blueprint it is a good idea to first
discuss the design on the mailing list.

Proposals for new features should be added to the issues for the
relevant project.  For example, `DOLFIN issues
<https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/dolfin/issues>`__ is the place
for proposals regarding the FEniCS user interface DOLFIN.
