Obtaining the source code
*************************

FEniCS uses Launchpad for hosting code. Each FEniCS component has a
`Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/>`_ repository on Launchpad
that contains all source code (including the entire development
history). The repositories are readable for everyone, but write access
is only granted to the members of the core teams.

Accessing the development repositories
======================================

To access the development repositories, you first need to install the
revision control system Bazaar. Visit the `Bazaar web page
<http://bazaar.canonical.com>`__ for instructions on how to install
Bazaar on your operating system.

Once Bazaar has been installed, you can access the development
repository of any FEniCS project by the ``bzr`` command. For example,
to check out the source code for DOLFIN, simply issue the following
command::

    bzr branch lp:dolfin

Notifications of updates
========================

Developers should subscribe to notifications of changes made to the
source code by visiting the repository on Launchpad and clicking the
subscribe button.

Links to the Launchpad code pages for all FEniCS projects can be found on the
:ref:`Launchpad links page <launchpad_pages>`.
