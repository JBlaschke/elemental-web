*************************
Obtaining the source code
*************************

FEniCS uses Launchpad for hosting code. Each FEniCS component has a
`Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/>`_ repository on Launchpad
that contains all source code (including the entire development
history) for the component. The repositories are readable for
everyone, but write access is only granted to the members of the core
teams.

Developers should subscribe to notifications of changes made to the
source code by visiting the repository on Launchpad and clicking the
subscribe button.
