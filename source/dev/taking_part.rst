Taking part in the development
******************************

The first thing a prospective developer needs to do is to register an
account on Launchpad and add herself/himself to the relevant project
teams. Membership to core teams is only granted after a developer has
proven reliable by committing a significant number of high quality
contributions.

.. Below, we describe how Launchpad is used to handle user questions, bug
.. reports, blueprints.

User questions
==============

User questions are discussed on the :ref:`help_answers` pages.
Developers should make sure to join the relevant team for each component so
that they will be notified about new user questions.

Bug reports
===========

Bug reports are discussed on the :ref:`help_bugs` pages.
Developers should make sure to join the relevant team for each component so
that they will be notified about new bugs.

.. _contributing_blueprints:

Blueprints
==========

FEniCS uses `blueprints <https://help.launchpad.net/Blueprint>`_ to
keep track of the specifications for new features. However, before
adding a new blueprint it is a good idea to first discuss the design
on the relevant mailing list.

`FEniCS blueprints <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fenics>`_ is the
place for general FEniCS blueprints and `DOLFIN blueprints
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/dolfin>`_ is the place for
blueprints regarding the FEniCS user interface DOLFIN. `Launchpad
pages <launchpad_pages.html>`_ contains a collection of links to the
blueprint pages for all FEniCS components.
