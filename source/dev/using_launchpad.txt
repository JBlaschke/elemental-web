Using Launchpad
***************

The FEniCS Project uses `Launchpad <http://www.launchpad.net>`_ as the
main development platform.

Each component of FEniCS is registered as a project on Launchpad and
each project is connected to a pair of teams. The first team consists
of developers and users interested in the development of the
project. This team is open to everyone and has a mailing list where
the development of the project is discussed. The second team (the core
team) manages the project and has write-access to the source code.

The first thing a prospective developer needs to do is therefore to
register an account on Launchpad and add herself/himself to the
relevant project teams. Membership to core teams is only granted after
a developer has proven reliable by committing a significant number of
high quality contributions.

An overview of all FEniCS projects on Launchpad can be found `here
<https://launchpad.net/fenics-project>`__. :ref:`launchpad_pages` also
contains a collection of links to important Launchpad pages for the
various FEniCS components.

Below, we describe how Launchpad is used to handle user questions, bug
reports, blueprints, and code hosting.

User questions
==============

User questions are discussed on the :ref:`help_answers` pages.
Developers should make sure to join the relevant team for each component so
that they will be notified about new user questions.

Bug reports
===========

Bug reports are discussed on the :ref:`help_bugs` pages.
Developers should make sure to join the relevant team for each component so
that they will be notified about new bugs.

.. _contributing_blueprints:

Blueprints
==========

FEniCS uses `blueprints <https://help.launchpad.net/Blueprint>`_ to
keep track of the specifications for new features. However, before
adding a new blueprint it is a good idea to first discuss the design
on the relevant mailing list.

`FEniCS blueprints <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fenics>`_ is the
place for general FEniCS blueprints and `DOLFIN blueprints
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/dolfin>`_ is the place for
blueprints regarding the FEniCS user interface DOLFIN.

`Launchpad pages <launchpad_pages.html>`_ contains a collection of
links to the blueprint pages for all FEniCS components.

Code hosting
============

FEniCS uses Launchpad for hosting code. Each FEniCS component has a
`Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/>`_ repository on Launchpad
that contains all source code (including the entire development
history) for the component. The repositories are readable for
everyone, but write access is only granted to the members of the core
teams.

Developers should subscribe to notifications of changes made to the
source code by visiting the repository on Launchpad and clicking the
subscribe button.
