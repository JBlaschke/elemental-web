Element manipulation
====================
In order to help support generic programming over a variety of 
(sometimes nonstandard) datatypes within Elemental, a number of very thin 
wrappers over standard mathematical library functions are provided.
Users who prefer to program with a single datatype and are comfortable with 
their language's standard library can safely ignore these routines.
