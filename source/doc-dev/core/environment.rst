Environment
===========
This section describes the routines and data structures which help set up 
Elemental's programming environment: it discusses initialization of Elemental,
call stack manipulation, a custom data structure for complex data, many routines
for manipulating real and complex data, a litany of custom enums, and a few 
useful routines for simplifying index calculations.
