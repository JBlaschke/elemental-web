``[MR,MC]``
===========
This is essentially the transpose of the standard matrix distribution, 
``[MC,MR]``. For a
:math:`7 \times 7` matrix distributed over a :math:`2 \times 3` process grid,
individual entries would be owned by the following processes (assuming the 
column and row alignments are both 0):

.. math::

   \left(\begin{array}{ccccccc}
     0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
     2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 2 \\
     4 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 4 \\
     0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
     2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 2 \\
     4 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 4 \\
     0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 
   \end{array}\right)

.. cpp:type:: DistMatrix<T,MR,MC>

   All public member functions have been described as part of
   :cpp:type:`AbstractDistMatrix\<T>` and :cpp:type:`DistMatrix\<T,U,V>`.
