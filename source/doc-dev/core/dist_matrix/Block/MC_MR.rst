The standard matrix distribution (``[MC,MR]``)
==============================================
This is by far the most important matrix distribution in Elemental, as the vast
majority of parallel routines expect the input to be in this form. For a
:math:`7 \times 7` block matrix distributed over a
:math:`2 \times 3` process grid,
individual blocks would be owned by the following processes (assuming the 
column and row alignments are both 0):

.. math::

   \left(\begin{array}{ccccccc}
     0 & 2 & 4 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 0 \\
     1 & 3 & 5 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 1 \\ 
     0 & 2 & 4 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 0 \\
     1 & 3 & 5 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 1 \\ 
     0 & 2 & 4 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 0 \\
     1 & 3 & 5 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 1 \\ 
     0 & 2 & 4 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 0  
   \end{array}\right)

Similarly, if the column alignment is kept at 0 and the row alignment is changed
to 2 (meaning that the third process column owns the first column of the 
matrix), the individual blocks would be owned as follows:

.. math::

   \left(\begin{array}{ccccccc}
     4 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
     5 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\ 
     4 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
     5 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\ 
     4 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
     5 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\ 
     4 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 0 & 2 & 4 
   \end{array}\right)
