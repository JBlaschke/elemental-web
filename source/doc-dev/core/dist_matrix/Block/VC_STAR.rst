``[VC,STAR]``
=============
This distribution makes use of a 1d distribution which uses a column-major 
ordering of the entire process grid. Since 1d distributions are useful for 
distributing *vectors*, and a *column-major* ordering is used, the distribution 
symbol is ``VC``. Again using the simple :math:`2 \times 3` process grid, 
with a zero column alignment, each subblock of a :math:`7 \times 7` block matrix
would be owned by the marked process:

.. math::

   \left(\begin{array}{ccccccc}
     0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
     1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
     2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\
     3 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3 \\
     4 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 4 \\
     5 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 5 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
   \end{array}\right)
