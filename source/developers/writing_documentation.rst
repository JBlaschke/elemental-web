Writing documentation
*********************

`FEniCS Documentation <https://launchpad.net/fenics-doc>`_ is a
component of the FEniCS Project. It is therefore organized and
maintained using the same framework as all other FEniCS components.
FEniCS and in particular DOLFIN are under active development, which
means that the documentation needs to be continuously updated. Any
help to accommodate this is greatly appreciated.

The documentation is generated by `Sphinx
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/index.html>`_ and uses `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ (reST) as the markup
language.  Good starting points are `reStructuredText primer
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_ and `Sphinx Markup Constructs
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/index.html>`_.

.. The :ref:`styleguides_sphinx_coding_style` explains what the reST
.. source files should look like.
