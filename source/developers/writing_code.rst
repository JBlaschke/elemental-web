Style guides for FEniCS software
********************************

We ask all developers and contributors to adhere to a common style
guide. This makes the job easier for maintainers who need to review,
edit and maintain the FEniCS code base.

Patches that don't follow the correct coding style will likely be
rejected, as the maintainer responsible for reviewing the patch must
otherwise make additional efforts to edit the patch to follow the
coding style.

C++ style guide
===============

Guidelines for writing C++ code are given in the
:ref:`developers_styleguide_cpp`.

Python style guide
==================

The FEniCS coding style for Python code adheres to the `PEP-8 style
guide <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ although it is not
strictly enforced.

Documentation styleguide
========================

The FEniCS documentation is generated by `Sphinx
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/index.html>`_ and uses `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ (reST) as the markup
language.  Good starting points are `reStructuredText primer
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_ and `Sphinx Markup Constructs
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/index.html>`_.

Further guidelines are given in the
:ref:`developers_styleguide_documentation`.
