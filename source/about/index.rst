About the FEniCS Project
########################

The FEniCS Project is a collaborative project for the development of
innovative concepts and tools for automated scientific computing, with
a particular focus on automated solution of differential equations by
finite element methods.

The methodology and software developed as part of the FEniCS Project
are documented in a number of :doc:`research articles <../citing/index>`
and a :doc:`book <../book/index>`.

**********
Components
**********

FEniCS is organized as a collection of interoperable components that
together form the FEniCS Project. These components include the
problem-solving environment :ref:`DOLFIN <about_components_dolfin>`,
the form compiler :ref:`FFC <about_components_ffc>`, the finite
element tabulator :ref:`FIAT <about_components_fiat>`, the
just-in-time compiler :ref:`Instant <about_components_instant>`, the
code generation interface :ref:`UFC <about_components_ufc>`, the form
lanuage :ref:`UFL <about_components_ufl>` and a range of
:ref:`additional components <about_components_additional>`. A deeper
look at these various FEniCS components can be found :ref:`here
<about_components>`.

Building on these components, software specialised to solving different
problems are organised into separate :doc:`applications
<../applications/index>`.

The FEniCS Project is developed by researchers from a number of
research institutes from around the world. The following research
institutes contribute significant resources to the FEniCS Project:

* `Simula Research Laboratory <http://www.simula.no>`__
* `University of Cambridge <http://www.cam.ac.uk>`__
* `University of Chicago <http://www.uchicago.edu/index.shtml>`__
* `Texas Tech University <http://www.ttu.edu/>`__
* `KTH Royal Institute of Technology <http://www.kth.se>`__

Contributions have also been made by researchers from `Chalmers
University of Technology <http://www.chalmers.se>`__, `Delft
University of Technology <http://www.tudelft.nl>`__, `Argonne National
Laboratory <http://www.anl.gov>`__ and many other research institutes.
A full list of contributors is maintained as part of the source code
of each FEniCS component.
